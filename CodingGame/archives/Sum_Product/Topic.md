## Goal
You must find the value of two positive integers A and B.  
For that, you will receive two other numbers:  
S, the sum of A and B  
P, the product of A and B

Output A and B separated by a space, with A smaller or equal to B.
## Input
Line 1: An integer S which is equal to A + B.  
Line 2: An integer P which is equal to A * B.

## Output
One line: 2 integers A and B separated by a space.

## Constraints
A ≤ B  
0 ≤ A,B ≤ 1000
